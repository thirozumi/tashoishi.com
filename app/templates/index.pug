          | A science fantasy symphonia distilled from the unconscious stress and stimulation culled from Tokyo's   buildings, fashion, illumination, advertisements - a fatal nest of inevitable power. The real life sound trendy drama transforming the city and the invisible into 9 pieces of music.
        p
          | Dentsu2060 begins with the re-summoning of tsuruta kinshi, I formed by Toru Takemitsu’s satsuma-Biwa rendition of November steps - a hyper-corporate and hyper-personal illuminated ensemble piece.
        p
          | SATOSHI NAKAMOTO is a documentary of the Shenzhen region, most likely inspired by J.G. Ballard's "Crash", the impression broadcast by Satoshi Nakamoto's visage, and the voice of the polygonal dragon that shows face in 1993's movie "Arcade". A speediness akin to MERIKARI or digital payment infrastructure's high octane overload.
        p
          | WINDOW OF HONEYTRAP belongs to the modern TINDER CONCRÈTE continuum.
          br
          | The tonal shift when the woman makes the install, the vocalization of her whispered voice and ridicule, finding definition beneath McDonald’s field recordings and foley,  as well as a synthesizing of a maximized romantic syndrome.
        p
          | Chase the rainbowbridge wa inspired by Initial D, intended for drives on tokyo’s Municipal highway to Tokyo bayside, created through the prophet VS’ vector synthesis.
        p
          | I Always Still Yakuza is a luxury field recording captured on floor 52 of the Park Hayat Shinjuku. The ambience of the Lost in Translation bar scene, scented with reverb.
